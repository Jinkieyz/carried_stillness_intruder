Carried Stillness Intruder

WiFi-reactive video installation using Channel State Information.

A room looks empty. It is not. Between the walls, 2.4 GHz electromagnetic waves bounce, reflect, absorb. When someone moves, the pattern changes. This project makes it visible.

The video responds to human presence detected through WiFi signal disturbances. Movement triggers CRT-like magnetic interference: the image bends, color channels separate, scanlines flicker. Stillness returns clarity.

Part of "in silico", graduation project at Konstfack University of Arts, Crafts and Design, 2026.

Technical: ESP32-C6 with ESPectre firmware, Sobel edge detection, WebGL CRT shaders.

Music: Dopplereffekt - Cerebral (1995)
